# mdn.io
> Short URLs for MDN

## Why?

When looking for JavaScript references, we usually Google `mdn bind` and clicking the first result.

mdn.io does that for you :)

## Usage

Need to look up `Function.bind`?

http://mdn.io/bind

## Starting the server

mdn.io has no dependencies, start it with:

`PORT=8080 node server.js`
